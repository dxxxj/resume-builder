**Resume Builder
**
Resume Builder is a simple React web application that allows users to create and customize their own resume. The application takes user input (such as personal details, education, and work experience) and dynamically generates a formatted resume that can be downloaded or printed.

Features
Dynamic Form: Users can fill out their personal information, education background, and work experience through a form interface.
Live Preview: As users fill in the form, they can see an instant preview of the resume.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Downloadable Resume: Users can download their resume as a PDF.
